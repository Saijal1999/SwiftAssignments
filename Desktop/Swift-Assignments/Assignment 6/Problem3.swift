//Define a class call MyNotification which contains a property called seen of type Boolean and a
//property called totalSeen of type int.
//• The class has a type method called searchIt which takes an array of number and a
//functional type called predicate of type (int)->Bool.
//
//
//• The class has another type method called fillIt which receives an input called size (of
//type int) and return an array with the size of the number. The fillIt method generates
//some random numbers between 1-100 to populate an array and return the array.
//• The array produced by the fillIt method is then given to searchIt method.
//• Then define 2 arbitrary predicates like
//o Predicate1: The number is dividend of 3
//o Predicate2: The number is an even number.
//• Call the searchIt function once with Predicate1 and once with Predicate2.
//• The searchIt function will iterate over the input array and apply the predicate to the items
//of the array. Any time, the predicate returns true, you should inform another class called
//MyObserver.
//• At each time the predicate holds, the MyObserver class is notified about two things:
//o 1- The fact that the predicate holds
//o 2- The item in the array on which the predicate holds
//• At the end of running each predicate on the array the MyObserver class will know about
//the following:
//o Number of times the predicate holds
//o The sum of numbers on which the predicate holds.
//• At the end the MyObserver class will print the following info: (the numbers re just
//examples)
//o Predicate1:    number of holds: 10 total: 87
//o Predicate2:    number of holds: 11 total: 81
//
//You should use the property observers to solve this problem.
