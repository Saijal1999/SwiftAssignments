Design and implement a function which takes 2 operands (numbers) and one operator
(plus, minus, multiplication and division) and applies the operator on the operands and
returns and prints the result.
Note: If operand1 is a non-zero number and the operand2 is zero, then the program
should not perform the division operand and should print the operation is not possible
because one number is zero (this is only for division operator) and return -1
