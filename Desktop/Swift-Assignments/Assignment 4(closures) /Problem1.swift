//Problem 1: Defining closure variables and constant
//Define the following:
//oA variable called func1 whose type is (Int, Int) -> Int
//oA variable called func2 whose type is (String) -> Void
//oA constant called func3 whose type is ()-> Int
//oA constant called func4 whose type is ()->[()->Void]
//oA constant called func5 whose type is ([(int)->Void]) -> [String]
//oA variable called func6 whose type is ([(int)->Void]) -> [(int)->void]
//oA variable called func7 whose type is ([(int)->Void]?) -> [(int)->void]?
//oA variable called func8 whose type is ([(int)->Void]?) -> [(int)->void]?
//oA variable called func9 whose type is () -> ((Int)->Int, Int)?


var func1  : (number1 : Int , number2: Int) -> Int

var func2 :   (Message : String) -> void

let func3 : () -> Int

let func4 : ()->[()->Void]

let func5 : ([(Int)->Void]) -> [String]

var func6 : ([(Int)->Void]) -> [(Int)->void]

var func7 : ([(Int)->Void]?) -> [(Int)->void]?

var func8 : ([(Int)->Void]?) -> [(Int)->void]?

var func9 : () -> ((Int)->Int, Int)?
